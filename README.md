# XenForo-BlackHatWorld

Running an influence campaign??? This script monitors the main page of the www.BlackHatWorld.com forum for specific phrases. BlackHatWorld is not a hacking site, it is an SEO/Internet Marketing forum. With minor editing, this script can be used on other XenForo forums. Optionally sends you a text if any of your search terms are found. 

The search_terms list has 'a' and 'i' as search terms for testing purposes. The sleep function is set to 15 seconds for testing. Depending on the time of day and how fast the posts are moving in the forum, 180 seconds is a better (minimum) sleep interval.
